# Running SAM in Browser

Running the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in a browser typically relies on the lightweight part of the model (especially the Mask Decoder). This functionality is implemented through frontend technologies (such as JavaScript, WebAssembly, WebGPU, etc.) combined with lightweight deep learning frameworks.

## 1. Browser Implementation Principles

The core concept of running SAM in the browser involves:

- Using the lightweight Mask Decoder component (part of SAM)
- Pre-computing complex Image Encoder features either in the cloud or locally, saving the image embeddings for browser decoder use
- Utilizing browser-supported deep learning inference frameworks (like ONNX Runtime Web, TensorFlow.js, or WebGPU)

## 2. Implementation Methods

### Method 1: Using ONNX Runtime Web

ONNX Runtime Web is specifically designed for running deep learning models in browsers and can load SAM components (especially the Mask Decoder) in the frontend.

Steps:
1. Generate Image Embeddings Offline
   - Run SAM's Image Encoder on server-side or offline systems
   - Save generated embeddings as *.onnx format or JSON data for browser loading

2. Load Lightweight Mask Decoder in Frontend
   - Use ONNX Runtime Web to load the lightweight SAM Mask Decoder
   - Process user prompts (points, boxes, or text) with embeddings to generate segmentation masks

3. Display Results
   - Generate and render segmentation masks in real-time

### Method 2: Using TensorFlow.js

Converting the entire Mask Decoder module to TensorFlow.js format allows direct browser execution. TensorFlow.js is a common solution for deploying deep learning models in browsers.

Steps:
1. Convert SAM's Mask Decoder to TensorFlow.js format (.json files)
2. Load the model using TensorFlow.js in frontend
3. Load pre-generated Image Embeddings and combine with user prompts
4. Render the model's segmentation output

### Method 3: Using WebGPU or WebAssembly

Latest browser technologies (WebGPU or WebAssembly) can be used for high-performance inference tasks, running SAM's lightweight components efficiently in the browser.

Tools:
- ONNX Runtime Web: Supports WebAssembly and WebGPU backends
- WebDNN: Supports optimized model execution on GPU or CPU
- Rust+Wasm: High-performance decoder components written in Rust, compiled to Wasm

## 3. Hardware Requirements

Browser-based SAM implementation requires:

- Modern browsers supporting WebAssembly (Wasm) or WebGPU (Chrome or Edge)
- CPU sufficient for lightweight Mask Decoder, GPU recommended for efficient inference
- Good data transfer performance (if loading Image Embeddings from server)

## 4. Summary

Browser-based SAM implementation relies on splitting the model workflow:

1. Image Encoder: Completed in backend or offline environment (one-time process)
2. Mask Decoder: Using lightweight model for real-time segmentation in browser

You can choose TensorFlow.js, ONNX Runtime Web, or WebAssembly for browser-side computation. Implementation complexity depends on embedding storage and transfer methods, but overall it's a viable solution.
